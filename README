NAME
    Email::Store::NamedEntities - Provides a list of named entities for an
    email

INSTALL
   The usual :
        
        % perl Build.PL
        % ./Build 
        % ./Build test
        % sudo ./Build install

   or, if you don't have Module::Build

        % perl Makefile.PL
        % make
        % make test
        % sudo make install


SYNOPSIS
    Remember to create the database table:

        % make install
        % perl -MEmail::Store="..." -e 'Email::Store->setup'

    And now:

        foreach my $e ($mail->named_entities) {
            print $e->thing," which is a ", $e->description,"(score=",$e->score(),")\n";
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This extension for "Email::Store" adds the "named_entity" table, and
    exports the "named_entities" method to the "Email::Store::Mail" class
    which returns a list of "Email::Store::NamedEntity" objects.

    A "Email::Store::NamedEntity" object has three fields -

    thing
        The entity we've extracted e.g "Bob Smith" or "London" w

    description
        What class of entity it is e.g "person", "organisation" or "place"

    score
        How likely like it is to be that class.
