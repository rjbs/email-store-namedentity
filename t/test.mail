In November of 1994, I caught a flight to San Francisco with the Guardian's
Tony Ageh, the designer Rik Gadsby, and the most terrifyingly efficient man
I'd ever seen in my life. His name was Ian Stewart. He was one of the
venture capitalists responsible for financing Wired in the US. While we
waited for the flight, he arranged us all Executive Club cards so we'd
never have to wait for another flight again. On the aeroplane, he reeled
off the best places to dine in San Francisco, largely in inflected
Japanese. He booked us into the most sumptuous hotel I could imagine, and
then invited us to an 8.00 am "working breakfast" at his hotel, which was
even grander. He spoke faster than Azeem on Speed, and twitched, as though
he was hearing stock market reports being read out by a voice inside his
head. Perhaps he was; it was impossible to tell. I had no guidelines: he
was the first Wired person I had met.

As it was, most of his tourist advice was wasted on me. I spent most of my
San Fran nights in my room, staring like a refugee at the cable TV. I was
not efficient. I was a slacker. Two months before I had been on the dole,
as I had been for three years, moonlighting in a broken-down stand-up show
about my BBS experiences. Then a man came up to me one night and asked me
what MPEG did. I explained, and he in turn explained that his name was Tony
Ageh and that he worked for the Guardian and he wanted to change the
political system in this country  and utilising new technology seemed to be
a good way of achieving this and he might be launching a UK version of
Wired and would I like a job?

And I said - and memory blurs whether these were my actual words at the
time -  if this gives me a chance to go to San Francisco and watch Talk
Soup and E! News and Mystery Science Theatre 3000 drunk at 3am in a black
and pink decorated bedroom and get paid for it, why the hell not?

I was taken along, because I was the only editorial person they had to show
the Wired US team. I'm thinking "this Ian Stewart guy commutes to his
London job from Switzerland, he got funding for Wired - the best fucking
magazine on the planet, he is the extropian ubermensch, and *he's* just
their money man. What are *they* going to be like?"

He turns to me and says, 'I'm sure Louis will be very interested in what
you have to say'.

And I'm thinking: Now I am going to have to fake this efficiency thing,
very, very seriously.

Nice try. Two days later, I lost my passport.
